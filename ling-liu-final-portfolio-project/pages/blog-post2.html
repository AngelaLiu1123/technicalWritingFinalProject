      <p>Do you know if the password you are using is secure? You may wish to guess together.</p>
      <p>What is the most popular password every year since 2013? "Qwerty?", "666666?" or "password?" You may not expect that the most popular password is "123456 ".

      <p>So how can you make your passwords less vulnerable to hackers and manage your passwords safely? Then you need to get to the root of the problem and set a few common passwords with a high-security factor. Some suggestions are given below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use different passwords for important accounts</strong></li>
        <p>Use separate passwords for important accounts such as online banking or email. There is a risk of reusing passwords. If someone steals the password for one of your accounts, that person could gain access to your email, bank accounts and other important accounts.</p>
        <li><strong>Don't use personally important information or common words as passwords</strong></li>
        <p>Set a password that has nothing to do with personal information, for example, you can choose any word or phrase and then insert letters and numbers in the middle and at the end of the beginning to make it more difficult to guess. Do not just use simple words (such as "password"), keyboard patterns (such as “qwerty”), or it will be easy for anyone to guess.</p>
        <li><strong>Password length as long as possible</strong></li>
        <p>Password try to keep more than 6-8 digits and should be composed of alphanumeric and symbols.</p>
        <li><strong>Use password management software</strong></li>
        <p>Using password management software can prevent your password from leaking, help you analyze your password security, and can modify the corresponding account according to the software's reminders. Commonly used password management software such as Bitwarden, 1Password, Dashlane, and Remembear , etc.</p>
      </ol>
