      <h1>HearthStone Battlegrounds Newbie Tips</h1>
      <img src="../images/blog4.png" alt="Image of Battlegrounds1">
      <p><strong>Hearthstone</strong> recent version of the update and let the tavern more new players. For many new players, if there are not enough cards, <strong>Battlegrounds</strong> is the first choice. However, newcomers want to quickly familiar with but not so simple, today let me take a look at the Battlegrounds beginner's strategy.</p>
      <h2>1.Basic setting</h2>

      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>After you finish the newbie tutorial of <strong>Battlegrounds</strong>, if you have ever played similar self-moving games, I believe you must be familiar with the basic rules, but those who have no relevant game experience need to understand the following contents carefully.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost (mint)</li>
        <p>You will get 3 coins in the first turn, and every turn after that you will get one more coin, with a cap of 10 coins, and the coins you have will be refreshed at the beginning of each turn, regardless of whether you used them up in the last turn or not, so make sure to use up your coins as much as possible each turn.</p>
        <li>Tavern Levels</li>
        <p>There are six levels of taverns, and each time you upgrade your tavern, you will need a certain amount of coins.</p>
        <li>Refresh and freeze</li>
        <p>Each refresh in the pub needs to consume 1 coin, so pay attention to your expenses, don't buy the pieces because you have no money because of the refresh. Of course, there are some special heroes whose refresh cost is different because of their skills, such as Milhouse, whose refresh cost is fixed at 2 coins.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>When you don't have enough coins to buy the pieces you need that turn, you can use the freeze function, each freeze and unfreeze does not consume coins, but note that the maximum number of freezes per turn is five, so don't miss key pieces because of greed.</p>

      <p><strong>The best figure minion</strong><em>is the one with the most attack power plus blood.</em></p>
      <p><strong>the highest attack frequency minion,</strong><em>such as minions with holy shields and deceased words, can all be counted as attacking twice.</em></p>
